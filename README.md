Introduction: This is Mini Project 5 ("Sorting out Sorting"), written by Madel Sibal & Sam Rebelsky.

Description: The following submission contains an implementation of insertion sort, merge sort, Quicksort, a TimSort-inspired sort, and test cases for the four sorting algorithms.

Resources: Oracle Help Center was used in order to figure out basic Java syntax and techniques. In addition, the readings/labs on sorting basics, merge sort, and Quicksort were an essential part of this project. Lastly, Professor Sam helped by providing the starter code and by clarifying the instructions of the projects during class and through his website. I used ChatGPT to help develop my TimSort-inspired sorting algorithm. (Citation: OpenAI. (2023). ChatGPT [Large language model]. https://chat.openai.com)
